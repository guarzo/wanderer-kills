In lib/wanderer_kills_web/controllers/subscriptions_controller.ex at lines 13 to
14, the init/1 function is currently a no-op placeholder. If no initialization
logic is required, remove this function entirely to avoid dead code.



In config/config.exs at line 4, the port is hardcoded to 4004, which limits
flexibility. Modify the port configuration to read from an environment variable,
such as using System.get_env("PORT") with a fallback to 4004 if the variable is
not set. This change allows the application to adapt to different environments
without code changes.
